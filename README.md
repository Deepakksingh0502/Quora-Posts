#SimonSays Game

I developed a Simon Says game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game
challenges players to remember and repeat sequences of colors in increasing
difficulty levels. Through HTML and CSS, I designed an intuitive and visually
appealing user interface. JavaScript was utilized to implement game logic,
including generating random sequences, handling user input, and keeping track
of score and progress.
